Scares us just thinking about it.

When you hear it,

you're gonna think we're insane.

Try us.

Please, from the start.

It started out small,

...like hand or leg was

in a different positions.

...like hand or leg was

in a different positions.

Then one day it was in a

completely different room.

It's moving around by itself.

Ever think that maybe somebody

had a key to your apartment?

Or just playing a trick on you?

That's exactly what we thought.

But never once that we find

any sign or evidence of intrusion.

And these all had led you to believe that

the doll was possessed?

Yes. Camilla got in touch with a medium.

We learned from her that a 7-year-old girl

named Annabelle Hagen had

died in this apartment.

She was lonely and took

a liking to my doll.

All she wanted was to be friends.

When we heard this, we

felt really sorry for her.

I mean we're nurses, we help people.

So... we gave her permission

to move into the doll.

Wait! You did what?

She wanted to live with

us by inhabiting the doll.

We said yes. But

then things got worse.

"Miss me?"

When we came home, she was

sitting in the hallway.

But we had left her

in the spare room.

"Miss me?"

Debbie! Debbie, wait!

We were beyond terrified.

We don't know what's going

on or what to do.

- Can you help us?

- Yes, we can.

But firstly, there is no

such thing as Annabelle.

And there never was.

Ghosts don't possess

such a power.

But I think what we have here is something

extremely manipulative.

It's something inhuman.

It was a big mistake

acknowledging this doll.

And through that the inhuman spirit

trick you.

You gave it permission

to infest your life.

What is an inhuman spirit?

In human form.
